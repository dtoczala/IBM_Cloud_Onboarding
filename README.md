# Welcome to IBM Cloud Onboarding
The IBM Cloud can be complex and somewhat overwhelming, but we're here to help you make sense of it.  This is a technically focused set of pages that will allow you to more easily onboard and effectively use the technology, see the latest best practices, and help you master the IBM Cloud.

# Introduction - Getting Started
You want to work on the IBM Cloud - but you want to be smart about what youy are doing.  We're here to help.  This is a collection of best practices and guidance on how to best administer, govern, configure and have your users onboard onto the IBM Cloud.  We're doing this as an open project on GitHub so we can share these practices with the wider community of IBM professionals and our customers.  Please feel free to contact [Daniel "Tox" Toczala](mailto:dtoczala@usibm.com), if you would like to contribute to this project.

The IBM Cloud is rapidly evolving and changing to better meet the needs of our customers.  If you have topics or subjects that you would like to see addressed here, please open an issue for this project, so we can have other community members begin to contribute and address these areas.

## Cloud Basics
The IBM Cloud has two major components, and it is good to have a basic understanding of both.

## Organization of the Materials
We have organized the material here to try to be helpful for the administrators of the IBM Cloud, the strategists using the IBM Cloud, and the developers and technical users of the IBM Cloud.  Each of these groups will have a "section" of this project, and you will see that this is organized around that ideal.
